    <h2>The History</h2>
    <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was founded in July of 1990. Also in the same year, the first disability pride parade was held in Massachusetts, but was discontinued after the lead organizer, Diana Viets, passed away. In 2004, the parade was revived in Illinois, with some 2000 people attending. 
    In 2015, Mayor de Blasio of New York City declared July to be Disability Pride Month in NYC in celebration of the ADA’s 25th Anniversary. Though not yet nationally declared, the disabled community has adopted New York City’s declaration.</p>

    <h2>Why Disability Pride Month?</h2>
    <p>Up until the late 20th century, disabled individuals were were unprotected against discrimination in education, transportation, the workplace, and other areas vital to a good quality of life. Even in today's capitalistic society, many able-bodied people still view disabled individuals as lesser humans in and out of the workplace. 
    These hostile viewpoints damage the mental health and self-esteem of people with disabilities. Therefore, Disability Pride Month is a crucial reminder for all that disabled people matter.</p>
